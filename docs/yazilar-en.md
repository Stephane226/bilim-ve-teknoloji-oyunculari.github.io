### Who We Are?
Science and Technology Actors (BTO) operate  within the ATU Theater Group, which started his activites in 2015. Acting courses started with the affectation of Dr. Öğr. Adem POLAT in 2019 as the club’s academic advisor and becoming the director, and BTO  present his first  theater 'Politool' in its first year.

BTO, which has adopted the Grotowski style of Poor Theater mood, continues its activities with the participation of volunteer students. At the beginning of each academic year, students recruitment are made for acting education. Students who want to participate can join the recruitment process with the announcement made at the beginning of each new academic year. 

### What is "Poor Theatre"?
The Poor Theater method, developed by Jerzy Grotowski, aims to give the message to the audience by acting, lacking all other elements of the actor. In the acting education process, the opportunity of developing the mental and physical limits of the person and discovering himself is provided. Self-discipline, self-confidence, team awareness, and observation from alternative perspectives are developed in the actor courses. The actor courses are given to all of our volunteer acting candidates throughout the year by our director, Dr. Adem POLAT.
